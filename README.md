# Prooza - An AI Assistant for Your Pricing Needs

This project is an experimental chatbot build with Python, ReactJS (Hopefully) and the Ollama Model to choose. It demonstrate on how an AI Model create a context-aware answers based on given additional trained data via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

This repository is part of **Machine Learning : Building AI Usecase using LLM Batch 2** project by Telkom Corporate University.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.9** or newer installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

And also, you'll need [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and pick up some model. Although, in this code we'll using Gemma3:1b from Google. So, after downloading the Ollama, go straight to Terminal or CMD (in Windows) and type:

```bash
ollama run gemma3:1b
# or
ollama pull gemma3:1b
```



### 2\. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 3\. Set Up the Virtual Environment

This project uses `uv` for fast and efficient environment management.

First, install `uv` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, create and activate a virtual environment within the project folder:

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install all project dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` using a single command:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command reads the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files to create an environment that exactly matches the project's specifications.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

_(Note: Use `main.py` or `app.py` depending on your main script's filename)._

Your web browser will automatically open to the application's interface.
